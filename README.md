We have created a web application in order to create a smooth and lucid user experience for those in need of blood and those who wish to donate it. The website has multiple features, created to serve hospitals and volunteers. Starting with the hospital portal, they can register themselves on our website by filling a form and can request blood for the patients in need from our stored blood stock. 

Moving ahead to the user portal, users also can sign up on the website and volunteer to donate blood. A form is available in the user dashboard that they can fill and book an appointment. The users can book their appointments to their specifications, in that they can have a time and place of their choice. 

Post donations users can see their donation history and they will receive a certificate of donation. 
The website also allows users to interact with the customer support through options like contact us and have the liberty of reading information about the website in the about us section.
There is a third facet to the website and it is created for the overall management, which is the adminâ€™s portal. 

Admin of the website has the authority to approve or reject the hospital requests for blood. The decision will be based on the available blood in stock. Admin however cannot reject a volunteer wishing to donate blood. Admin can view the donor list to check for the authenticity of the user appointments. Admin has the access to the contact us queries raised by the users and answer them.
